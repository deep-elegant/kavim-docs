## What is Kavim

**Kavim** is an open-source, privacy-first **AI-powered brainstorming canvas** that lets you and your friends think, draw, and chat together - without giving your ideas to someone else’s cloud.

Whether you’re a **creator**, **founder**, or **team of tinkerers**, Kavim gives you a shared space where:
- You can **brainstorm in real-time** with others
- Chat with multiple AIs and **branch your thoughts** visually
- Keep everything **stored locally** and **under your control**

No “uploading,” no “syncing,” just a clean offline-first app that makes collaboration feel human again.

## Why Kavim

Kavim was designed to balance creativity, control, and simplicity:

- **🎨 Visual & fluid brainstorming**
  Turn scattered notes into connected ideas - chat with multiple AIs, branch your thoughts, and explore every direction without getting lost in endless links.

- **🤝 Real-time collaboration**
  Invite friends or teammates to join your canvas instantly - powered by peer-to-peer tech.
